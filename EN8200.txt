 The Sixth World Parliamentarians Convention on Tibet 

Adopted on 29 April 2012

WHEREAS
We, the delegates to the Sixth World Parliamentarians’ Convention on Tibet meeting in Ottawa, Canada, from 27 to 29 of April 2012,
Recalling the findings and statements of the previous five Conventions held in New Delhi, Vilnius, Washington D.C., Edinburgh and Rome, and having reviewed the activities and programs that resulted from these meetings and their impact,
Having reviewed the grave situation in Tibet as well as the policies of the Government of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in relation to the Tibetan people,
Noting with disappointment the lack of progress in dialogue between the Government of the PRC and the Envoys of His Holiness the Dalai Lama since the meeting of the World Parliamentarians’ Convention on Tibet in Rome in November 2009,
Reaffirming the great value to humanity of the Tibetan culture, language and spiritual tradition,
Recognizing the very important and successful democratization process in the governance of Tibetans in exile by His Holiness the Dalai Lama and the recent transfer by him of his political powers and responsibilities to the democratically elected Kalon Tripa and political leaders of the Central Tibetan Administration, which represents the aspirations of the Tibetan people,
Convinced of the continued indispensable role of His Holiness the Dalai Lama in bringing about a negotiated solution to the conflict between the Government of the PRC and the Tibetan people,

WE THEREFORE
Reiterate our firm conviction that this conflict can be resolved through sincere and constructive dialogue and negotiations at the highest level between the Government of the PRC and His Holiness the Dalai Lama or his representatives and the democratically elected political leaders of the Central Tibetan Administration,
Express our equally firm belief that unilateral action in Tibet by the government authorities of the People’s Republic of China, such as the imposition of new policies that do not reflect the aspirations of the Tibetan people, cannot lead to a solution,
Welcome the free and fair character of the elections held last year for the Kalon Tripa and for the members of the Tibetan Parliament in Exile, which the INPAT Election Observation Mission monitored and reported on,
Acknowledge the growing movement for democratic change among the Chinese people as well as the increasing understanding and support among Chinese for the Middle Way approach of His Holiness the Dalai Lama, all of which has potential impact on the realization of the aspirations of the Tibetan people,
Mindful that the yearning for democratic freedom is unstoppable as evidenced most recently in many parts of the Arab world, in Burma and elsewhere,
Understand the critical importance of freedom of information and of access to it through the internet and other electronic means of communication to the success of democratic movements,
Are alarmed at continuing grave violations of human rights in Tibet and the repressive measures taken by the PRC authorities in reaction to these and other peaceful protests by Tibetans,
Continue to be deeply concerned at the attacks by the authorities of the People’s Republic of China on Tibetan Buddhism as well as their policies and practices that destroy, repress, or discourage the preservation and development of other facets of the distinct identity of the Tibetan people, including their culture, language, customs, way of life and traditions, and which display elements of cultural genocide,
Are saddened and moved by the large number of Tibetans who set fire to themselves in protest against Chinese government policies and for a restoration of freedom for Tibetans and the return of His Holiness the Dalai Lama,
Are seriously worried by recent calls by persons of standing and influence with the Chinese Communist Party for the removal of existing provisions on autonomy for Tibetans and other ‘minority nationalities’ in the constitution and laws of the PRC, which would have very negative domestic and international implications,
Acknowledge the ineffectiveness of the bilateral human rights dialogues that governments have held with the PRC in bringing about necessary change,
Welcome the consideration of the human rights situation in Tibet by the United Nations Human Rights bodies and mechanisms, including by the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights and the Treaty bodies as well as through the Special Procedures of the UN Human Rights Council, but regret that no concrete action has been taken by the Council itself,
Deeply regret the apparent lack of political will of the Government of the PRC to respond positively to persistent efforts by His Holiness the Dalai Lama and the elected Tibetan leadership for the resumption of the dialogue,
Reject the argument made by the government of the PRC that the engagement of governments with His Holiness the Dalai Lama and members of the elected Tibetan leadership and the expression of support by governments for the peaceful resolution of the issue of Tibet through dialogue and negotiations constitute breaches of the ‘one China policy’,
Remain convinced that a sustainable solution to the issue of Tibet can be achieved  through genuine autonomy for the Tibetan people within the PRC, as evidenced by the positive experience of the many autonomous regions around the world, and note in particular the example set by the creation of the Territory of Nunavut as a self governing community within the sovereign nation of Canada.

WE DECIDE AS FOLLOWS:
Express solidarity with the Tibetan people in their non-violent struggle for their rights and freedoms including the right to determine their own destiny,
Express support also for the Chinese people’s efforts to bring about democratic change to their country and urge that this be achieved in ways that ensure the exercise by the Tibetans of their rights and freedoms and safeguard the rights of other other minority peoples in the PRC as well,
Express concern at the domestic and international efforts by the Government of the PRC to curtail the freedom of information and control electronic and internet communications for political purposes,
Reaffirm our strong commitment to the people of Tibet and the non-violent path they have chosen, under the inspiring leadership of His Holiness the Dalai Lama and
commend the Kalon Tripa for his continuing efforts to pursue the Middle Way approach and to promote a resumption of the dialogue with the PRC,
Endorse the principles set out in the Memorandum on Genuine Autonomy for the Tibetan People, which provide the basis for a realistic and sustainable political solution to the issue of Tibet,
Recall the important invitation of Deng Xiaoping to His Holiness the Dalai Lama to discuss and resolve any issues except the independence of Tibet, and note that this position has been repeated by the Government of the PRC more recently also,
Dispel the false accusation that His Holiness the Dalai Lama and the Central Tibetan Administration is seeking separation from the PRC since the Tibetan proposals expressly formulate a solution within the constitutional framework of the PRC and therefore call upon the government of the PRC to cease to propagate such misinformation,
Call upon the Government of the PRC to end the repression in Tibet, provide access to all Tibetan areas in the PRC, schedule the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights’ mission to China and especially to Tibet, and to resume the dialogue with the Envoys of His Holiness the Dalai Lama in that same positive spirit,
Urge leaders of all governments and relevant international organizations to support and promote this dialogue and to engage the government of the PRC in the potential for serious consequences should it scrap its constitutional and legal provisions on autonomy,
Alert the international community to the serious nature and consequences of the ongoing destruction and repression of Tibetan culture, language and religion by the policies of the Government of the PRC,
Offer to work with members of the National People’s Congress to jointly ascertain the causes of protest and unrest in Tibet, including the self-immolations,
Urge the Government of the PRC and the international community to address the environmental challenges on the Tibetan plateau where environmental stewardship profoundly affects life in vast regions of Asia, including in China and countries in South and Southeast Asia,
Commit to introducing and/or keeping these issues on the agendas of our own parliaments and international parliamentary organizations and to persuade our own governments to address them in high level discussions with the Government of the PRC, His Holiness the Dalai Lama and the democratically elected Tibetan leadership,
Urge governments to create multilateral mechanisms to address the situation in Tibet and to promote a peaceful resolution of the conflict and, in particular, call on the European Union to implement the European Parliament resolution for the appointment of a Special Coordinator for Tibetan Affairs and on relevant national governments to support this initiative,
Make available our own expertise both to the Government of the PRC and to His Holiness the Dalai Lama and the leadership of the Central Tibetan Administration in order to assist in the furtherance of the objectives contained in this declaration,
Adopt an action program to ensure greater effectiveness in addressing the concerns and advancing the objectives contained in this declaration.
